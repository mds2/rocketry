You can work it all out, tie it together, and figure out why constant $v_e$ chemical rockets have to be giant (and mostly consist of fuel) to achieve spaceflight $\\Delta v$\n",

Conversely, what if we could save some of the spent fuel exhaust from burning a piece of fuel, impart all the energy onto a smaller piece of fuel exhaust, and launch that reaction mass later?\n",
